# Challenges 1 - 4

## Challenge 1

I used the button.html file to do the challenge!

Your challenge is to write jQuery in script.js file and add CSS to the style.css file to make the following changes to the blue button in the button.html file. Apply the following behavior to the blue button in the button.html file:

1) Create a CSS class (makeRed, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a red color, apply this class to the button Element (add to class attribute in the html).

2) Create another class (makeBorder, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a border of 2px, do not apply to the HTML.

3) On mouseenter remove the red class and add the border class.

4) On mouseleave reverse the above.

Use method chaining to achieve the above.

## Challenge 2

When the button is clicked, make the paragraph slide up.
When clicked again, make it slide down.

This effect is a real-world example of how jQuery can be used on a button or a menu item.

## Challenge 3

Now try hide() / show() and fadeIn() / fadeOut() on button click.

1) Create a second button and paragraph. Run the code and click on the buttons

## Challenge 4

Go to www.eir.ie/ and inspect the page. In the console write:

    $("a").attr("href","https://codeinstitute.net/");

Then click on the homepage and you are directed to codeinstitute.net :-)
