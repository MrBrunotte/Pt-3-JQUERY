# Edit a tags and button elements

Edit your html file to change all the a tags to button elements. Donâ€™t forget the closing tag and to remove the href attribute. Make the first button hide when clicked. 

On the same button, try the slow, medium, fast, and a number in milliseconds (you will need to refresh to get the button back).

    $("#html_button").click(function () {
        $("#html_button").hide("medium");
        //$("#html_button").hide(3000);
    });

The last line is commented out, but remember that the milliseconds only have numbers (its not a string!)
